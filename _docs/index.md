Dr. Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul, Dr. Morakot Choetkiertikul and Asst. Prof. Dr. Thanwadee Sunetnanta have been awarded the [Newton Fund (Industry Academia Partnership Programme - 18/19 from the Royal Academy of Engineering, UK)](http://www.newtonfund.ac.uk) on the project "Automated Software Engineering for Thailand's Software Industry".

<img width="500px" src="../../img/news/2019-2.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">

The SERU team from Thailand side (Mahidol) will partner with [Dr. Jens Krinke (UCL)](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.krinke/), [Dr. Federica Sarro (UCL)](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/F.Sarro/), and [Prodo.ai company](https://prodo.ai) from the UK side to transfer the knowledge and expertise in automated software engineering (ASE) from the UK to Thailand.

The research team (SERU + UCL) will work with four rising stars in Thai software companies ([ProGaming](https://www.progaming.co.th), [Zwiz.AI](https://www.zwiz.ai), [Course Square](https://www.coursesquare.co), [Trinity Roots](https://www.trinityroots.co.th)) on identifying the gaps in their software development projects/processes, organising series of workshops and trainings, and observing the improvements after adopting state-of-the-art ASE tools/techniques into their companies. We hope that this 2-year project will enhance the quality of the software and the development process of Thailand's software industry.
